Key contributions likely include applying Bayesian neural networks to breast histopathology image classification and quantifying uncertainty in predictions. </br>
The three models implemented may include a standard convolutional neural network, a Bayesian neural network, and potentially a hybrid or ensemble approach.</br>
Variational inference is commonly used in Bayesian neural networks to approximate the posterior distribution over weights. It allows for tractable inference in complex models.</br>
Adaptive activation functions can allow the network to learn more flexible decision boundaries. This may improve performance on histopathology images.</br>
Aleatoric uncertainty relates to inherent noise/randomness in the data, while epistemic uncertainty stems from model uncertainty. Quantifying these can improve model robustness and provide confidence measures for predictions.</br>

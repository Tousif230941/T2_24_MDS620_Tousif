The two key types of loss in training a VAE are: </br>
a) Reconstruction Loss: This measures how well the VAE can reconstruct the input data from the latent representation. It typically uses metrics like mean squared error or binary cross-entropy to compare the original input to the reconstructed output.</br>
b) KL Divergence Loss: This measures the difference between the learned latent distribution and a prior distribution (usually a standard normal distribution). It acts as a regularizer, encouraging the latent space to be well-structured and continuous.</br>
Key differences between traditional autoencoders and VAEs:</br>
Latent space: Traditional autoencoders learn a deterministic mapping to a fixed-dimensional latent space, while VAEs learn a probabilistic mapping to a distribution in latent space.</br>
Output: Traditional autoencoders output a single reconstruction, while VAEs can generate multiple plausible outputs for a given input.</br>
Loss function: Traditional autoencoders typically use only reconstruction loss, while VAEs use both reconstruction loss and KL divergence loss.</br>
Generative capabilities: VAEs are true generative models that can sample new data, while traditional autoencoders are primarily for dimensionality reduction or feature learning.</br>
The reparameterization trick:</br>
The reparameterization trick is a method to make the sampling process in VAEs differentiable. It's needed because sampling from a distribution is a non-differentiable operation, which prevents backpropagation through the network.</br>
The trick involves expressing the sampled latent variable z as a deterministic function of the distribution parameters (μ and σ) and an auxiliary noise variable ε:</br>
z = μ + σ * ε, where ε ~ N(0, 1)</br>
This allows gradients to flow through the sampling process, enabling end-to-end training of the VAE12.</br>
Training process of a VAE:</br>
a) Encode the input data to get the parameters of the latent distribution (μ and σ).</br>
b) Use the reparameterization trick to sample from this distribution.</br>
c) Decode the sampled latent vector to reconstruct the input.</br>
d) Compute the reconstruction loss between the input and the reconstruction.</br>
e) Compute the KL divergence between the learned latent distribution and the prior.</br>
f) Combine the reconstruction loss and KL divergence to get the total loss.</br>
g) Backpropagate the gradients and update the model parameters.</br>
h) Repeat steps a-g for multiple epochs until convergence.</br>
This process allows the VAE to learn both an efficient latent representation of the data and a generative model that can produce new samples</br>

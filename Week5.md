Here is a concise summary of the key points about the main idea, thesis statement, and topic sentences:

## Main Idea

- The main idea is the central concept or message that an essay or paper discusses or analyzes throughout. It is the overarching idea that ties the entire piece together[1][3].

## Thesis Statement 

- The thesis statement is a 1-2 sentence statement, usually found in the introduction, that explains the main argument or point of the essay[1][5].
- It provides the focus and direction for the rest of the essay[3].
- All body paragraphs and the conclusion will connect to and support the thesis statement[5].

## Topic Sentences

- Topic sentences express the main idea of each body paragraph[1][4].
- They are usually the first or last sentences of a paragraph[4].
- Topic sentences help organize the essay and keep the writing focused on the main idea[1][3].

In summary, the main idea is the central concept, the thesis statement is the 1-2 sentence expression of that idea, and topic sentences state the main idea of each body paragraph to support the thesis. Together, they provide structure, focus and organization to an essay.
